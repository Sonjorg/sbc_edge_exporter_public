# 👋 Hi, I'm Sondre

🔧 I created [`sbc_edge_exporter`](https://sondre4.gumroad.com/l/yisqf), a specialized exporter for Ribbon SBC Edge metrics.

## Prometheus exporter for Ribbon Communications SBC Edge routers
#### Developed by Sondre Jørgensen in cooperation with Sang Ngoc Nguyen at NTNU: Norwegian University of Science and Technology, sondre2409@gmail.com and 29sangu@gmail.com as part of our bachelor's thesis. Developed for and in cooperation with Stig Atle Haugen at HDO
Used together with a Prometheus server where metrics can be gathered from exporter-host-ip:5123/metrics. Metric types are grouped as collectors where each collector can be excluded for each host, ref. Configuration.
- Version 1.1 (github branch main, docker image sondrjor/edge_exporter:1.1) is a version where each SBC host are configured in config.yml.
- Version 2.0 (github branch hdo, docker image sondrjor/edge_exporter:2.0) is a version that uses a separate docker container for each SBC host. It uses docker compose, ref. Configuration version 2.0
- Version 2.1 (github branch hdo) Added temperature as a metric.
### Configuration

#### Configuration v1 (branch main)
#### The exporter must be configured in config.yml in the root folder of this repository.
```
---
authtimeout: 3  #all hosts will have max 3 sec timout
hosts:
- hostname: Host1
  ipaddress: 11.111.111.11
  username: Username1
  password: Password1
  routing-database-hours: 24 #For routingentry collector, data is stored in the database for 24 hours for this host.
- hostname: Host2
  ipaddress: 11.111.111.12
  username: Username2
  password: Password2
  routing-database-hours: 24
- hostname: Host3
  ipaddress: 11.111.111.13
  username: Username3
  password: Password3
  routing-database-hours: 24
  exclude:
   - routingentry
   - system
   - diskpartition
   - systemcallstats
   - linecard
   - ethernetport
#Excluding the above collectors for this host
```
- It is required to set hostname, ipaddress, username and password for each SBC.
- You can choose which collectors you want to exclude for each host by adding them to the list "exclude" as shown above. The name of the collectors have to match exactly as spelled in this example.
- "Authtimeout" is the maximum chosen time to attempt authentication to a host. Usually it is not reachable if the duration is more than 1-2 second.
- "routing-database-hours" is the duration of which data related to the routingentry collector is stored within the database. Fetching new data through http takes several extra seconds per scrape. Metrics are never stored, only data such as routing tables and their routing entries.
- It is recommended not to configure too many hosts per docker instance because of performance issues.

### Deployment running docker
Run:

    sudo docker build -t edge_exporter .

You should always use an external config.yml. Start an instance with:

    sudo docker run -v path/to/your/config.yml:/usr/src/exporter/config.yml sondrjor/edge_exporter

Metrics can be gathered from ```host:5123/metrics```

#### Configuration version 2.0 (branch HDO)
###### Exporter for each SBC reside in separate docker containers

Create the following docker-compose.yml file and run it with ``` docker-compose up ```.

Alternatively run each docker instance with ``` docker run -e hostname=test -e ipaddress=111.111.111.111 -e username=un -e
password=pw -e authtimeout=2 -e routing_database_hours=24 -p 4000:5123 --name container_name sondrjor/edge_exporter:2.0 ```

```

## Grafana and prometheus setup with docker
Choose between grafana local or grafana cloud
#### Grafana local
This is a setup with grafana-docker hosted locally, following a similar approach as this tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJx7QTrTyo&t=712s

The config for all docker images used, resides in the docker-compose.yml file

### Deployment of grafana with docker
Use

    docker compose up -d

in either directory ```edge_exporter\Other\Grafana-Prometheus\grafanacloud``` or ```.../grafanalocal```, respectively

## test docker containers:
### get ip address of grafana container

    sudo docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' grafana

    curl ip-address:3000

### Restart all containers if changes are made to docker-compose.yml

    docker-compose up -d --force-recreate

### check status in log files for a container

    sudo docker-compose logs -f container-name

## Tips for further development of the exporter
### Deployment of the exporter on a linux server
**The exporter is developed and tested for the official ubuntu server image found at https://ubuntu.com/download/server.**
- Download golang using the official download page: [install golang](https://go.dev/doc/install), and remember to reboot.
- Do not install go with apt install because then it downloads an old go version which this repo does not support (this repo uses go 1.20), use wget.
- To start the exporter and download all necessary packages, navigate to the sbc exporter directory and run

      go install
### To test go exporters:

    go run .

in the edge_exporter directory, then use

    curl localhost:9100/metrics

in another windows to view live metrics data that can be collected by prometheus.

### To test a specific file, for use

    go run main.go
However this will not make use of dependencies from other files

### Installation of Go on highly secured ubuntu VMs
#### As root folders are not accessible on some VMs, we need to install Go to the home directory if docker is not utilized
- Download last version of Go to home directory, from Go's official website
- Unzip the file with tar
- Execute the commands:

      export GOPATH=$HOME/go
      export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

- If starting Go gives a message that its not yet installed, make a startup script that executes:

      source .bashrc

from home directory
